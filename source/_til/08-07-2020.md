title: Spell checker on Vim
language: EN

---

As I've writing some TIL posts lately, and I'm doing that using **VIM** as my main editor for it.

Sometimes I get a little bit worried about typos / wrong spelling as I'm not a native English speaker sometimes I do some silly errors (also on grammar, but that's another post for here hehe)

Vim already have a spell checker that we can set the language like that:

```
set spelllang=en
```

And enable it with `set spell`, if we want to have this enabled every time that we open VIM, we need to add the "`set spell`" on our `.vimrc` or `.config/nvim/init.vim` for neo Vim

As now we have it enabled, we should be able to use it, so here are some commands that I've been using:

|Command|What does it do|
|---|---|
|`z=`|It'll open another page with a numbered list of alternatives to that wrong word, you can choose one number of this list and press enter, it'll change the word for the one chosen|
|`]s`|It moves to the next misspelled word after the cursor|
|`[s`|It moves to the misspelled word before the cursor|
|`zg`|Adds the word under the cursor to the dictionary as a "correct word", so it'll not warn next time that you have that word|
|`zw`|Like `zg` but adds the word to the dictionary as a "wrong word"|
|`zug`/`zuw`|Undo what `zg` and `zw` did|

------------

## Adding spell check per file type

If you want to enable the spell checker automatically based on the type of the file you can add the code below on your `.vimrc` or `.config/nvim/init.vim` for neo Vim.

```
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.md setlocal spell
```

This will enable the spell checker only for markdown files, so you won't get errors on some code stuff that it's not really wrong.

If you want to take a deeper look on the spell checker, take a look on the documentation here [http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/spell.html](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/spell.html)
