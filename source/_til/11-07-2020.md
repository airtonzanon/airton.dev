title: Creating a file in VIM's explorer (Netrw)
language: EN

---

Every time that I'll browse my files when using **VIM** I use `:e .` it'll open the default explorer of VIM: Netrw

One thing that I was struggling was creating new files there, because I always needed to put VIM in background, then create the file, and then editing it on VIM. That was making me madness.

So I started searching and some TIL articles or even the documentation says, use `%` when on Netrw and it'll ask the filename. Noob as I'm I was trying to do `:%`.

But it's just pressing the character `%`, so: `shift + 5` (at least in my keyboard hehe).

I hope it also helps some people that doesn't pay attention as myself.
